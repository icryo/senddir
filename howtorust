Installing Rust
Go to the official Rust website (https://www.rust-lang.org/).
Click on the "Install" tab at the top of the page.
Choose your operating system (Windows, macOS, or Linux).
Follow the instructions provided on the website for your operating system.
Verify that Rust has been installed correctly by opening a terminal or command prompt and typing rustc --version. You should see a message with the version number of Rust.
Building a Project with Cargo
Open a terminal or command prompt.
Create a new directory for your project by typing mkdir my_project.
Change into the new directory by typing cd my_project.
Initialize a new Rust project using Cargo by typing cargo init.
Open the Cargo.toml file in your favorite text editor.
Modify the [package] section of the file to include your project's name, version, and description.
Add any necessary dependencies to the [dependencies] section of the file. For example, if you want to use the rand crate, you would add rand = "0.8.4" to the [dependencies] section.
Write your Rust code in the src/main.rs file.
Use Cargo to build your project by typing cargo build.
If there are no errors, you should see a message indicating that the build was successful.
Run your project by typing cargo run.
